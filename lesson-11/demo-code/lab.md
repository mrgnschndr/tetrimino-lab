# Task #4 

## What wins or better understanding did you have at the end of this lab?

This lab made me feel WAY more comfortable with CSS selectors and the concept of using pseudoclasses. I would also call a win the concept of flexbox and its features and capabilities. I feel very comfortable when items are prebuilt into rows and columns for me (and I would say rows are more comfortable than columns).



## Which concepts of the lab do you still feel you need to work on?

Although I feel completely comfortable with the concept of flexbox and most of selector use, I still feel I need to work on the properties of flexbox to know which ones to use without going through a process of trial-and-error. The lab taught me flex- wrap, order, and direction very well, but I'm not sure I feel as comfortable with creating the flex container from scratch and building things into columns or rows, along with positioning properties like justify-content/items vs. align-content/items. I think trying to rebuild my pet profile page from my proposal using flexbox would give me the understanding I need for those properties (which I will do!).
